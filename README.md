# driver-license
A program that takes user information and converts it into a driver's license number.

This application will encode driver's licenses for Illinois, Florida, and Wisconsin. I found the information for the encoding at <a href="http://www.highprogrammer.com/alan/numbers/dl_us_shared.html">this site</a>.

<h1>Compiling</h1>
What you will need:
- Visual studio (I used 2013 express, but other versions should work as well) or another C# compiler

To open the code in visual studio, go to visual studio, click on open, then select the solution (.sln) file and open it. In the solution explorer to the right of the screen, click on "Program.cs", which is the actual code. When you want to compile, click the arrow next to the "Debug" button (it's to the right of the big "Start" button with the green arrow), and select "Release", then click "Start". If you are not done with editing the code, but want to test it, leave the compile option to "Debug".

Also do not edit the "Soundex.cs" file, as it is a class and nothing in it needs to be changed.

<h1>Help</h1>
If you have any questions about this, or need help editing something, feel free to open an issue or send me an email at dragonbanshee@gmail.com. I usually can respond pretty quickly, but sometimes, if i'm busy, I may not be at my phone or computer and may not answer right away. If you want to also, you can add me on <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragonbanshee">Steam</a>.
