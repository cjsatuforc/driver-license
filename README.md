# driver-license
A program that takes user information and converts it into a driver's license number.

At the moment it only works for Illinois driver's licenses, but that's only because I haven't gotten to other states yet. I found the information for the encoding at this site: http://www.highprogrammer.com/alan/numbers/dl_us_shared.html

What you will need to compile this code:
- Visual studio (I used 2013 basic, but other versions should work as well)

To open the code in visual studio, go to visual studio, click on open, then select the solution (.sln) file and open it. When you want to compile, click the arrow next to the "Debug" button (it's to the right of the big "Start" button with the green arrow), and select "Release", then click "Start". If you are not done with editing the code, but want to test it, leave the compile option to "Debug".
